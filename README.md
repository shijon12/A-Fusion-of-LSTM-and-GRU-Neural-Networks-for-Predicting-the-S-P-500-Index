# A-Fusion-of-LSTM-and-GRU-Neural-Networks-for-Predicting-the-S-P-500-Index
# Description
This project develops a hybrid deep learning model combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) architectures to predict the S&P 500 index. The model improves forecasting accuracy by leveraging the strengths of both LSTM and GRU networks, which include handling long-term dependencies and adapting quickly to changes in the data, respectively. The project encompasses the entire workflow from data preprocessing, model building, performance evaluation, and comparison against standalone LSTM and GRU models.

# Features
Hybrid LSTM-GRU Model: Utilizes a novel combination of LSTM and GRU layers for improved prediction accuracy.
Data Preprocessing: Implements data cleaning, normalization, and partitioning into training and test sets.
Performance Metrics: Evaluates models using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
Visualization: Includes plots for loss metrics and predictions to visualize model performance.
