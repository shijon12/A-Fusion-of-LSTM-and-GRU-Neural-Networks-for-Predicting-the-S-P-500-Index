# A-Fusion-of-LSTM-and-GRU-Neural-Networks-for-Predicting-the-S-P-500-Index
The proposed model combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to utilize their respective strengths in capturing long-term dependencies and adapting to less persistent features in time-series data.
